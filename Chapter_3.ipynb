        "# Explain Python raise statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The `raise` statement in Python is a mechanism for explicitly triggering exceptions in your code when an error or invalid condition occurs. In the statement `raise ValueError(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\")`, the `raise` keyword generates a `ValueError` exception, which is a built-in Python error used to indicate that a function or operation has received an argument with an inappropriate value. The accompanying message `\"Division by zero is not allowed.\"` provides additional context about the specific error, making it easier for developers or users to understand what went wrong. This ensures that the program halts at the point of error and does not proceed with invalid or undefined behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the `raise` statement is executed, Python immediately stops the normal flow of the program and begins searching for an exception handler, such as a `try` and `except` block, to address the error. If no handler is found, the program terminates, and Python provides a traceback showing where the error occurred, along with the custom error message. Using the `raise` statement in this way allows developers to enforce proper input validation, handle edge cases gracefully, and provide meaningful feedback to users, thereby making programs more robust and easier to debug.\n",

        "## Key Points\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Immediate Error Handling:**\n",

        "# While True\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python code while True: is a construct for creating an infinite loop. Here's an explanation of its components and behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Explanation:\n",
        "- while Loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as its condition evaluates to True.\n",
        "- Condition True:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In this case, the condition is the literal True, which is always true. As a result, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly stopped.\n",
        "- Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Infinite loops are often used for tasks where the program needs to keep running until a specific condition or event occurs (e.g., waiting for user input, monitoring a system, or managing a server).\n",
        "- Exiting the Loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - To prevent the loop from running forever, you typically include a mechanism to break out of it, such as the break statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Behavior:\n",
        "In the example above, the loop will continuously prompt the user for input until they type \"exit\". When this happens, the break statement terminates the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Risks:\n",
        "If no break statement or other exit mechanism (like an exception) is provided, the loop will run indefinitely and may consume system resources, potentially causing the program to hang or crash. Always ensure you have a clear way to stop infinite loops when implementing them."

        "\n",
        "- Waiting for User Input:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use an infinite loop to repeatedly prompt the user until they provide valid input or request to exit.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Server or Service Monitoring:\n",
        "  - Continuous loops are often used in servers or background processes that need to run indefinitely until stopped manually or by an event.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Game Loops:\n",
        "  - In games, an infinite loop manages the game state, player input, rendering, and updates until the player exits.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polling Systems:\n",
        "  - Infinite loops can be used for periodically checking for updates, like monitoring a file, database, or external service.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Cautions with while True:\n",
        "- Risk of Infinite Execution:\n",
        "  - Without a proper exit mechanism (e.g., break or exception handling), the loop will run indefinitely, consuming system resources and potentially causing the program to hang or crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "- High CPU Usage:\n",
        "  - A while True loop without any delays (e.g., time.sleep()) can cause high CPU usage, impacting system performance. Always include a small delay if the loop does not require continuous high-speed execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Difficult Debugging:\n",
        "  - An infinite loop without clear conditions or exit points can make debugging challenging, especially if it locks up the program. Always document the exit conditions and test thoroughly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mismanagement of Resources:\n",
        "  - If the loop involves resources like file handles, database connections, or network sockets, failing to manage these resources (e.g., not closing them) can lead to memory leaks or system instability.\n",
        "\n",
        "- User Experience:\n",
        "  - In user-facing programs, infinite loops can frustrate users if there's no clear way to terminate the loop (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C or providing an \"exit\" option).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Include an Exit Condition: Always ensure the loop has a clear and reachable exit point.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use Delays for Non-Critical Loops: Add time.sleep() for loops that do not require continuous execution.\n",
        "- Test Exit Scenarios: Verify that the loop exits correctly under all expected conditions.\n",
        "- Log Progress: In complex loops, log progress or states for debugging and monitoring purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using while True responsibly, you can harness its flexibility for various scenarios while avoiding potential pitfalls.\n"
